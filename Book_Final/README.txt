The code in these folders comes from the examples presented in _Practical
Prototype & script.aculo.us_ by Andrew Dupont.

Since these two JavaScript libraries are common to every example, they're
found in the "js" folder, and are referenced from the chapter-specific
folders via relative path.

NOTE: Any example that involves the use of a PHP file (any file with a .php
extension) will need to be accessed from a server that has PHP installed.
These examples will not work when viewed directly on the local disk. You may
find XAMPP (http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) useful if you need
such an environment on your machine.
